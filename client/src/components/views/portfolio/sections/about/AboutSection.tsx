                            An enthusiastic software engineer who strives to
                            make the world a better, more sustainable place.
                            I&apos;m passionate about contributing to solutions
                            that derive real-world change, and positively affect
                            the lives of others.

                            I am very lucky to live in beautiful Kelowna, BC
                            with my wonderful wife and my energetic dog Goose. I
                            graduated from the University of British Columbia
                            (UBCO) in 2018 and have been enjoying my work as a
                            software engineer since.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I love riding my bike everywhere I can â€” to the
                            grocery store, on camping trips, and mountain biking
                            in the surrounding hills. I am passionate about
                            bicycles and alternative methods of transportation
                            as means to improve the lives of others and to save
                            the environment.

                            I am currently working with Spare to build the
                            future of sustainable transportation using Node.js,
                            React.js, and TypeScript.
