                        I am very lucky to live in beautiful Kelowna, BC with my
                        wonderful wife and my energetic dog Goose. I graduated
                        from the University of British Columbia (UBCO) in 2018
                        and have been enjoying my work as a software engineer
                        since.

                        I love riding my bike everywhere I can â€” to the grocery
                        store, on camping trips, and mountain biking in the
                        surrounding hills. I am passionate about bicycles and
                        other alternative methods of transportation as means to
                        improve the lives of others and to save the environment.

                        I am currently working with Spare to build the future of
                        sustainable transportation. I am a software engineer on
                        the Launch team, and work across the stack using
                        Node.js, React, and TypeScript.
