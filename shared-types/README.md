# @blog/shared-types

Define Typescript types which are shared between different modules (e.g. `api` and `client`).

## Build

```
yarn build
```

## Use types in another module

These types can be referenced from other modules (e.g. `api` and `client`) by running the commands below:

```
cd <new-dir>
npm install ../shared-types
```

## Updating types

1. Make your changes
2. Run `yarn build`
