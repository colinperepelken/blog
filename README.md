# Colin Perepelken's Blog

A simple blog built with React, Typescript, Node.js and PostgreSQL.

## `TODO`

- ~~Remove `open-api-client-axios`, and OAS file as it is overkill for this project, and is preventing me from using react-scripts v5, which is required for Tailwind~~
- ~~Rebuild an api client from scratch in `client`~~
- ~~Upgrade to react-scripts v5~~
- ~~Set up Tailwind~~
- ~~eslint auto-remove unused imports~~
- Fix footer display issues when switching between Blog and Portfolio views
- Ensure website is responsive and works on mobile devices
- Continue building the blog portion of the website...
