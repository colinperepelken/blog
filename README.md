# Colin Perepelken's Blog

A simple blog built with React, Typescript, Node.js and Postgres. Currently a work in progress...

## `TODO`

- ~~Remove `open-api-client-axios`, and OAS file as it is overkill for this project, and is preventing me from using react-scripts v5, which is required for Tailwind~~
- ~~Rebuild an api client from scratch in `client`~~
- Upgrade to react-scripts v5
- Set up Tailwind
- Continue building out the client...
- Continue building out the api and database...
